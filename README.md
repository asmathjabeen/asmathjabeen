# 👋 Hey, I'm Asmath Jabeen!

A Computer Science graduate with a passion for building useful tools with Python. I focus on writing clean code, visualizing data meaningfully, and creating apps that make tech more accessible — especially for non-technical users.

## 💼 Tech Focus

- **Languages**: Python, Java, C  
- **Libraries & Tools**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit, Git  
- **Other Skills**: SQL, HTML/CSS, Basic Web Workflow

I'm currently deepening my skills in Python development and preparing for entry-level software roles that demand problem-solving, logic building, and curiosity.
